        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate area above.</li>
          <li>Read the problem statement.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Nouns and Verbs" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Defining Diagram" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Checking the Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Code the JavaScript program.
            <ol>
              <li>Add code after the line: <code class="varname">YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:</code> to complete this lab.</li>
              <li>Your output should look like the <strong>Example Output</strong> at the bottom of this lab.</li>
              <li>Your code should be efficient and you should avoid unnecessary repetition of code.</li>
              <li>Remember to follow all coding standards and add appropriate comments!</li>
              </ol>
          <li>Test this</li>
          <ol>
            <li>How many test cases do you think you need to properly test all possible ways this program will work? I'm only requiring you to provide 3 written ones, but you may need more.
            <strong>Read the problem carefully to make sure you handle ALL possible cases.</strong></li>
          </ol>
        </ol>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the above problem statement and paste it below so it appears in the black box when you refresh the page, underneath the words <code class="varname">PROBLEM STATEMENT</code>.</li>
          <li>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and write them in the appropriate locations so they appear in the black box below when you refresh the page.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a JavaScript program that asks the user how many kids were in their family when growing up and how many bedrooms there were in the house. 
For the sake of simplicity let's only code for 1, 2, or 3 or more kids, and 1, 2, 3 or more bedrooms. Look at the following chart and output a message for every combination of kids and bedrooms.


Nouns: kids, bedrooms, message

Verbs: asks user how many kids in family, asks how many bedrooms in house, output
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</li>
          <li>Make your variable names <strong>valid JavaScript names</strong> that conform to the course JavaScript Coding Standards.</li>
          <li>Write down the processes with very short statements, 2 or 3 words. Remember, this is not pseudocode. This is just the process.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
kids
bedrooms

PROCESSING:
prompt number of kids
prompt number of bedrooms
if kids is 1 and bedrooms is 1 then 
  message is Lucky
else if kids is 1 and bedrooms is 2 then
  message is Spacious
else if kids is 1 and bedrooms is 3 then
  message is empty feeling
else if kids is 2 and bedrooms is 1 then
  message is Cozy
else if kids is 2 and bedrooms is 2 then
  message is Lucky
else if kids is 2 and bedrooms is 3 then
  message is Spacious
else if kids is 3 and bedrooms is 1 then
  message is Crowded
else if kids is 3 and bedrooms is 2 then
  message is Cozy
else if kids is 3 and bedrooms is 3 then
  message is Lucky
EndIf
Display kids
Display bedrooms
Display message    

OUTPUTS:
Display kids
Display bedrooms
Display message  

</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a solution algorithm (using Pseudocode) based on the defining diagram. Remember to give your algorithm a name and use proper indentation.</li>
          <li>Ensure you include an appropriate level of detail for your input, processing, and output logic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This solution algorithm will be complex and will require many nested IF
          statements. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. <strong>Be specific in your steps for this and think through this
          problem carefully.</strong>
        </p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
// YOUR SOLUTION ALGORITHM GOES AFTER THIS LINE:

PromptForKidsAndBedroomsOutputMessage
  prompt kids
  prompt bedrooms
  if kids is 1 and bedrooms is 1 then 
    message is Lucky
  else if kids is 1 and bedrooms is 2 then
    message is Spacious
  else if kids is 1 and bedrooms is 3 then
    message is empty feeling
  else if kids is 2 and bedrooms is 1 then
    message is Cozy
  else if kids is 2 and bedrooms is 2 then
    message is Lucky
  else if kids is 2 and bedrooms is 3 then
    message is Spacious
  else if kids is 3 and bedrooms is 1 then
    message is Crowded
  else if kids is 3 and bedrooms is 2 then
    message is Cozy
  else if kids is 3 and bedrooms is 3 then
    message is Lucky
  else
    message is numbers out of range
  EndIf
  Display kids and bedrooms and message
END

</pre>

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a test plan for the algorithm.
            <ul>
              <li>Don't forget to fill in the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section! That's easy to miss!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Have <b>at least 3 test cases</b> that test different inputs and outputs. Ensure you cover bad data entry as well as the &quot;golden path.&quot;</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
VARIABLES: kids, bedrooms, message

TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES: 1, 1

  EXPECTED RESULT: With 1 kids and 1 bedrooms you must feel lucky!

  ACTUAL RESULT: With 1 kid and 1 bedrooms you must feel lucky!

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES: 3, 1

  EXPECTED RESULT: With 3 kids and 1 bedroom you must be crowded!

  ACTUAL RESULT: With 3 kids and 1 bedroom you must be crowded!

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES:  1, 3

  EXPECTED RESULT: With 1 kid and 3 bedrooms it must feel empty!

  ACTUAL RESULT:
</pre>

        <h3>5. JavaScript Code</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done.</li>
          <li>You will need to follow the coding standards for the course.</li>
          <li>Once everything is working, go back and <strong>fill in</strong> the actual results sections in the test plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example Output</h3>

<pre class="output">
With 1 kid and 3 bedrooms you must have an empty feeling!
</pre>

<pre class="output">
With 3 kids and 1 bedroom you must be crowded!
</pre>

<pre class="output">
With 2 kids and 2 bedrooms you must feel lucky!
