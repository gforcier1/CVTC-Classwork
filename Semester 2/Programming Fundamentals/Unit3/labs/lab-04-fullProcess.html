        <h2>Lab 4: Full Process</h2>

        <h4>File: /labs/lab-04-fullProcess.html</h4>

        <h3>Student Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Name: Gunnar Forcier</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate place.</li>
          <li>Using the three examples you just reviewed, complete all sections of this lab in Notepad++, and test your results in Firefox. It is important to do them all in order. Follow the instructions for each section.</li>
          <li><strong>You will follow this approach for the rest of the learning units in this course.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p><em><strong>A program is required to prompt the user for a first name and a last name. The program will create a greeting that starts with "Hi, " followed by the first name, followed by a space, followed by the last name. The application will then display the greeting on the page.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Copy the above problem statement and paste it below so it appears in the black box when you refresh the page, underneath the words <code class="varname">PROBLEM STATEMENT</code>.</li>
          <li>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and write them in the appropriate locations so they appear in the black box below when you refresh the page.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A program is required to prompt the user for a first name and a last name. The program will create a greeting that starts with "Hi, " followed by the first name, followed by a space, followed by the last name. The application will then display the greeting on the page.

Nouns: firstName, lastName, greeting

Verbs: prompt, display
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>


        <ul>
          <li>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</li>
          <li>Make your variable names <strong>valid JavaScript names</strong> that conform to the course JavaScript Coding Standards.</li>
          <li>Write down the processes with very short statements, 2 or 3 words. Remember, this is not pseudocode. This is just the process.</li>
        </ul>


<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  firstName
  lastName
  greeting

PROCESSING:
  prompt firstName
  prompt lastName
  calculate greeting
  output greeting
  

OUTPUTS:
  output greeting

</pre>
        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>


        <ul>
          <li>Create a solution algorithm (using Pseudocode) based on the defining diagram.</li>
          <li>Follow the pattern of the Examples, including indentation, a name for your solution algorithm, and an "END".<strong> Don't just use BEGIN or START. Give it an actual name, starting with a capital letter, using camelCase naming conventions like in the demos.</strong></li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
SOLUTION ALGORITHM:
BEGIN

calculateGreeting
  prompt for firstName
  prompt for lastName
  greeting is equal to "Hi, plus space plus firstName plus space plus lastName plus "
  display greeting
  
END


</pre>
        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Create a test plan for the algorithm.
            <ul>
              <li>Don't forget to fill in the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section! That's easy to miss!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Have <b>at least three</b> test cases that test different inputs and outputs.
            <ul>
              <li>Have some interesting test cases where the first and last names are not just one simple word.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
VARIABLES: firstName, lastName, output

TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES: Gunnar, Forcier

  EXPECTED RESULT: "Hi, Gunnar Forcier"

  ACTUAL RESULT: Hi, Gunnar Forcier

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES:Gunnar Forcier, Forcier

  EXPECTED RESULT: "Hi, Gunnar Forcier Forcier"

  ACTUAL RESULT:Hi, Gunnar Forcier Forcier

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES: John, Ham

  EXPECTED RESULT: "Hi, John Ham"

  ACTUAL RESULT: Hi, John Ham

</pre>

        <h3>5. JavaScript Code</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done.</li>
          <li>You will need to follow the coding standards for the course.</li>
          <li>Once everything is working, go back and <strong>fill in</strong> the actual results sections in the test plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Your Output:</h3>

<pre class="output">
<script id="student_code">
// YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:

//Define VARIABLES

var firstName = "";
var lastName = "";

firstName = prompt("Enter your first name:");
lastName = prompt("Enter your last name:");

document.write("Hi, " + firstName + " " + lastName);


// END OF YOUR CODE
</script>
</pre>

        <h3>What You Did</h3>
        <p>You just went through the full process of developing an application! You found the nouns and verbs, you did a Defining Diagram, you created a solution algorithm with pseudocode, you devised a test plan, you wrote your code with documentation, and you tested your code, checking it against your testing plan.</p>
        <p>We will be doing this over and over again in this class.</p>
